This year NAACL-HLT will once again feature a plenary panel on [Careers in NLP](https://2022.naacl.org/program/keynotes-panels/#panel-careers-in-nlp) which will take place on Monday, July 11, at 1:15 - 2.15 pm PDT. 

The panel includes Yang Liu, Timo Mertens, Thamar Solorio, and Luke Zettlemoyer and will be moderated by [Yunyao Li](https://yunyaoli.github.io).  Our panelists represent a diversity of NLP careers and will discuss multiple topics including trends in NLP careers, emerging skills, prominent challenges and opportunities for cross-functional collaboration as an NLP professional in todayâ€™s organizations.

To keep the panel discussion relevant and interesting to the audience, we would like to invite you to fill out the following [survey](https://forms.gle/xd2M5z5kvpXs7Pjv9). It should take no more than 5 minutes. Please use this survey to share the questions and topics you would like to have included in the panel discussion.
