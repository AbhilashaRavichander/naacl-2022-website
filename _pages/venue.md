## Conference Venue

The NAACL-HLT 2022 conference will be held at [**Hyatt Regency Seattle**](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/washington/hyatt-regency-seattle/sears) (808 Howell Street, Seattle, Washington, United States, 98101).

## Accommodation

In addition to the conference hotel (Hyatt Regency Seattle), there will be another student accommodation (**information TBA**).

Attendees can also search for alternative lodging. With the lightrail running to North Seattle, areas such as Roosevelt, University District, and Capitol Hill are safe and commute-friendly neighborhoods to stay in.

## Visa Information

The following questions will help you in determining whether and how to apply for a U.S. visa to attend the conference. 

**Can I travel to the U.S. without a visa?**

Please see [this page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html) to determine whether you are eligible to apply for an [Electronic System Travel Authorization (ESTA)](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/) instead, which might be cheaper and easier.  This is usually allowed if you hold a passport from a country that participates in the Visa Waiver Program, but there are some exceptions.  Be sure to apply for the ESTA at least 72 hours in advance.  [_Do not_](https://visaguide.world/tips/how-to-avoid-esta-fraud/) purchase your ESTA from any website other than the one linked above.

**What kind of visa do I need?**

To attend the conference, you should apply for a nonimmigrant B-1 visa.  (This also [permits](https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/documents/B-1%20permissible%20activities.pdf) you to engage in tourism during your trip.)

**How do I apply for a visa?**

Please apply well in advance.  Visa applications can take from 1&ndash;4 months to be approved and normally require an interview at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate.  For details, begin [here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html) and navigate to the website for the embassy or consulate nearest you for further visa instructions.

**How much will it cost?**

The non-refundable visa application fee is [approximately $160](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/fees/fees-visa-services.html#temp) in local currency.  Depending on your nationality, you may also have to pay a [visa issuance fee](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/Visa-Reciprocity-and-Civil-Documents-by-Country.html).

**Why should I request a visa invitation letter?**

A letter is not specifically required.  However, you are supposed to [bring documentation](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html) to your visa interview.  Bringing a letter from the conference organizers can help to establish the purpose of your trip: for example, we can document that you are coming to present a paper.  You can request such a letter [here](http://www.yesevents.com/NAACL-Visa).

In addition, if you have already paid for your registration, bringing your receipt can help to establish your ability to pay.  In some countries, it may also be wise to bring a letter from your own institution that authorizes you to attend the conference.

**What other documents may be needed in the visa interview?**

The answer to this question varies by the country where the interview is conducted, and perhaps also by your nationality.  Typically you will be asked to bring:
- your visa interview appointment letter
- [suitable](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/photos.html) photos or digital images
- your passport, valid for at least 6 months beyond the period of stay in the U.S.
- DS-160 application confirmation page
- application fee payment receipt

You may also bring other documentation that will help you answer the interviewer’s questions.  The interviewer is particularly interested to establish:
- The purpose of your trip.  See the previous question.  You may also be asked to bring your CV.
- Your intent to depart the United States after your trip.  You may wish to show your return ticket, and evidence of your work and family responsibilities outside the U.S.
- Your ability to pay all costs of the trip.  You may wish to show your bank statement, or evidence of travel grants or sponsorships, etc.
- Your U.S. stay address.  You may wish to bring your hotel booking information.

**Is it safe to go ahead and register for the conference before I have a visa?**

Yes. If your visa application is denied, you are entitled to [request](mailto:office@aclweb.org) a full refund of your conference registration fees.
