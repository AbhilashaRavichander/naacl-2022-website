First, we would like to acknowledge the tremendous amount of work of many people volunteering their time for creating what we hope will ultimately be a better review system for our community. We understand that using ARR as the main submission mechanism to NAACL 2022 has created some confusion and frustration. We are working closely with the ARR team and the ACL 2022 program chairs to address issues that arose and ensure that the transition is as smooth as possible moving forward. We appreciate the support we have received from the community in this process---all of you make the conference possible by volunteering to review papers, submitting great reviews on time, and taking the time to share feedback and constructive suggestions.

In addition, we would like to particularly recognize the work of several groups of people. 

**ARR Reviewers and Action Editors**
will be recognized as NAACL 2022 Reviewers and Area Chairs. All ACL Rolling Review reviewers for papers submitted for the December and January cycles will be officially listed as Reviewers for NAACL 2022. Similarly, the Action Editors for the December and January cycles will be officially listed as Area Chairs for NAACL 2022.

**ARR and OpenReview team members**
will be recognized as part of the NAACL 2022 team. In particular, we would like to thank:

- Amanda Stent and Goran Glavaš, as ARR Editors-in-Chief for NAACL 2022
- Graham Neubig, Dhruv Naik and Nils Dycke, as ARR Tech Team for NAACL 2022
- Celeste Martinez Gomez, Melisa Bok, and Nadia L'Bahy, as OpenReview Tech Team for NAACL 2022.

**NAACL 2022 Best Reviewer Awards**<br>
NAACL 2022 will recognize outstanding contributions by reviewers. The award will acknowledge the quality of reviews as judged by Action Editors and Senior Area Chairs. The criteria include constructive and thorough reviews submitted on time, engagement in the reviewers’ discussion if initiated by the Action Editor, and availability for emergency reviewing. All reviewers who served in ARR for the December and January cycles will be considered for the Best Reviewer Award for NAACL 2022.

**NAACL 2022 Best Area Chair Awards**<br>
NAACL 2022 will also recognize outstanding contributions from Area Chairs, as judged by the Senior Area Chairs. The criteria include meta-reviews submitted on time, engagement with reviewers, and availability for emergency meta-reviews. All Action Editors in the ARR December and January cycles will be considered for the Best Area Chair Award for NAACL 2022.

Thank you to everyone working with us to make NAACL 2022 a success!

Marine, Marie & Ivan
NAACL 2022 Program Chairs
