Dear authors,

The [ARR January site](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/ARR/2022/January) is open for your submissions to NAACL 2022! The deadline to submit is January 15.

Four things to keep in mind:

- Make sure to use the ARR template (not doing this entails a desk-reject)
- Remember that per the new ARR policy, submitting a paper means reviewing if asked
- Submitting requires filling in the checklist for Responsible NLP Research (see our [previous blog post](https://2022.naacl.org/blog/responsible-nlp-research-checklist/))
- Submissions on "[Human-Centered NLP](https://2022.naacl.org/blog/special-theme/)" should be submitted to the dedicated [OpenReview site](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/NAACL/2022/Conference) (not ARR!) to be reviewed as part of the NAACL 2022 special theme. 

Looking forward to your submissions!

Marie, Marine & Ivan
NAACL 2022 program chairs
