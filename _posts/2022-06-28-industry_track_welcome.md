The industry track was first introduced to a major NLP conference at [NAACL-HLT 2018 in New Orleans](https://naacl2018.wordpress.com/2017/12/01/greetings-from-the-industry-track/) and has since become a standard track at the NAACL conferences. The Industry track provides a forum for researchers, engineers, and application developers to exchange ideas, share results and discuss use cases of successful deployment of language technologies in real-world settings.

This year we received 128 paper submissions in response to our [call for papers](https://2022.naacl.org/calls/industry/). Five submissions were rejected without review due to incompleteness, non-compliance with format requirements, or double submission policy. Our program committee reviewed the remaining 123 papers with a rich representation of the present spectrum of NLP researchers and professionals. Each submission was reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Reviews solicited committee opinions along two primary aspects: _Focus on real-world applications_ and _lessons offered by the paper_. Reviews also considered clarity, methodological rigor, ethical use of datasets, and compliance with conference guidelines. The senior [area chairs](https://2022.naacl.org/committees/industry/) then reviewed each paper and the reviews and provided their recommendation along with a short metareview. Finally, we accepted [40 papers ](https://2022.naacl.org/program/accepted_papers/#industry-track)based on committee recommendations as well as alignment of the papers with the goals of the industry track (acceptance rate of 32%). 

NAACL-HLT 2022 Industry Track also features the now traditional  [“Careers in NLP” panel ](https://2022.naacl.org/program/keynotes-panels/#panel-careers-in-nlp)discussion. This year we are expanding the range of careers discussed in the panel by introducing a career in product. The panel will be moderated by [Yunyao Li,](https://yunyaoli.github.io/) and we expect the conversation to include trends in NLP careers, emerging skills, main challenges and opportunities for cross-functional collaboration as NLP professionals in today’s organizations, and more. We will be publishing a separate blog post soon inviting you to submit questions to the panel. Stay tuned!
