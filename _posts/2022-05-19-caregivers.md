To foster inclusion of caregivers and families at NAACL, the D&I team has embarked on several initiatives to provide support for conference attendees who are balancing professional and family commitments. This year, you can apply for a subsidy from NAACL to offset the additional childcare costs associated with bringing your children with you or with being away from home overnight. The subsidy can be used to compensate a self-arranged childcare provider at the conference or at home, or to defray the cost of a plane ticket for your children or caregiver to accompany you to the conference.

You can request a subsidy by submitting an application via [this link](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=DQSIkWdsW0yxEjajBLZtrQAAAAAAAAAAAAO__UAd5zRUN1NBTjlZVlRYOFE0U0g2TkVKQVJLVjRTSS4u). Please apply by **May 24**. Since applications are evaluated on a rolling basis, we strongly encourage you to apply ASAP before the funding runs out. If you don’t have receipts by the time you apply, you can use estimates such as quotes from the service providers.

The conference will provide nursing rooms and family-friendly essentials such as backup diapers and wipes. To better assist you, we encourage you to fill out [this survey](https://forms.office.com/r/0HZgbksDJm) (no matter if you attend in person or virtually) where you can submit your needs and we’ll try our best to accommodate them.

We are also organizing an online childcare social where you can connect to other parents and prospective parents, share your experiences, and discuss the challenges of balancing professional and family commitments and other topics based on [the survey](https://forms.office.com/r/0HZgbksDJm). More details to come on NAACL 2022’s website.

To help you connect with other families at the conference, we are creating a mailing list for attendees who indicate during registration that they might bring children to NAACL. (If you have already registered but would like to be added to the list, please [let us know](mailto:naacl-2022-dei-chairs@googlegroups.com).)

Here is a list of childcare service providers in the area. We did not vet any of these and we cannot guarantee that the nannies they provide are insured/background-checked. We encourage you to check these and other childcare services and carefully consider the safety and appropriateness of any childcare provider.   

*   On Call Nanny (<https://www.oncallnanny.com/>)
*   College Nannies + Sitters (<https://www.collegenanniesandsitters.com/>)

Your questions, suggestions, or comments are warmly welcomed. Please feel free to [contact the D&I team](mailto:naacl-2022-dei-chairs@googlegroups.com). We are all looking forward to helping you and your family enjoy NAACL 2022!
