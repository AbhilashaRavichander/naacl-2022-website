To continue the People Of NLP: Two Truths and a Lie social initiative started for NAACL 2021, we would also like to collect submissions for NAACL 2022.

See previous examples [here](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23PeopleofNLProc&f=live).

This year we would like to feature junior researchers (especially those from marginalized/under-represented communities or non-US institutions/backgrounds) through our official NAACL account ([@naaclmeeting](https://twitter.com/naaclmeeting)) on Twitter.

Our goal is to feature 2-5 folks a week in the weeks leading up to the conference. We hope to be able to feature all those who submit information, but this will also depend on the volume of submissions we receive. You do not need to have a Twitter account in order to participate!

Please consider answering the questions and sharing this survey with colleagues: <https://forms.gle/cvrBXWRzo8F54mSA6>

_NOTE: By participating, you give us permission to share the submitted information through the NAACL Twitter account._

Please submit your information by **May 29th**.
