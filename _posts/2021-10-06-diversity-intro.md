This blog post introduces the D&I team, describes the upcoming efforts and D&I survey.


## Open call for D&I subcommittee

In the [D&I panel and business meeting](https://youtu.be/mCVY4mRqNok) of NAACL 2021, we received feedback that D&I committees should be more open and accessible. The deeply unbalanced geographical distribution of NAACL 2021 attendees was also highlighted in the same meeting ([link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HoJVQjxDB9pFJPrasAd8ubyJj2k0grfy/view)). In July 2021, we released an [open call](https://forms.gle/EebMcboaGtMr26hn9) for folks to apply for the D&I sub-committee, where we received over 50 responses. After careful consideration, D&I advisors and the general chair constituted this D&I subcommittee based on factors like understanding of D&I issues, outreach ability, experience in D&I volunteering and advocacy, and availability.

![Statistics for the geographical distribution of NAACL 2021 attendees. Stats are as follows: North America: 1095, South America: 71, Europe: 447, Africa: 21, Asia: 478, Oceania: 25](/assets/images/diversity-blog/distribution.png)

## Diversity and inclusion initiatives

For NAACL 2022, our key novel initiatives will be:



* **Research mentorship**: We plan to provide mentorship on the works, planned to be submitted at the main conference and workshops. This is mainly to help marginalized folks to strengthen their submissions.
* **Affinity group events and mini-workshops**: We plan to organize events to promote and highlight work from members from various affinity groups and provide a platform for communities to grow. These events will be in the form of presentation sessions, socials, D&I sessions and so on.

More information about these initiatives will be announced soon. We will also put major efforts on diversifying representation, participation and outreach, travel and registration grants, accessibility and better childcare services.


## Funding for NAACL 2022 D&I

Our D&I initiatives would not be successful without the help from sponsors. The D&I sponsorship would go to providing compute for research mentorship, funding travel grants and registration waivers for underrepresented folks, providing accommodations for researchers with disabilities and more. If you or your company is interested in sponsoring NAACL D&I initiatives, please contact the [sponsorship chair](https://2022.naacl.org/committees/organization/#sponsorship-chair).


## [D&I survey](https://forms.office.com/r/XUxP8XSN5N)

We are very interested in knowing how the conference can improve in ways that make all attendees feel welcome and included. This survey will help us in making better decisions regarding the D&I initiatives. The survey includes general D&I questions and **optional sections** on accessibility, childcare, financial and academic inclusion. As part of several efforts to improve inclusivity at NAACL, we ask that you fill out [this demographics and inclusion survey](https://forms.office.com/r/XUxP8XSN5N). This should take about 15-20 minutes of your time. The form will be open till the end of NAACL 2022, but ideally, please fill the survey by the **end of November**. This will help us in making better decisions regarding our budget and plans.
