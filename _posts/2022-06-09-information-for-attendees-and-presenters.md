[The conference program](https://2022.naacl.org/program/) was designed to allow for presentation and attendance in person in Seattle and virtually from all over the world. 
In addition to the paper presentations, the program includes several [plenary sessions](https://2022.naacl.org/program/keynotes-panels/), 
which we hope will provide thought-provoking perspectives that will enrich discussions during the conference and beyond. 
The industry track, demonstration tracks and student research workshop will offer dedicated sessions during the main conference days. 
The program also includes papers published by the Transaction of the ACL and Computational Linguistics journals. 
Furthermore, papers accepted for publication in the Findings of NAACL 2022 were also given the option to be presented as posters during the main conference.

Below we give more information to participants and presenters to address frequently asked questions. 
If you have further questions, please contact the program chairs.

## For Participants

The NAACL 2022 conference will be in hybrid format, allowing presenters and attendees to participate in person in Seattle and online via the Underline platform.
All plenary sessions and oral presentations will be live-streamed and recorded. 
The Q&A will be open to online and in-person questions. 
Some authors might have opted to post a recording of their oral presentation to Underline prior to the conference.
All posters will be available on the Underline platform, with a 3 to 5 minute video presentation. 
All main conference posters will also be presented in online Q&A sessions on zoom that bring together a small number of posters on similar themes to foster discussion. 
Furthermore, authors who attend the conference in Seattle will present their poster in person during traditional poster sessions.
Note that sponsors will have both in person and virtual exhibition spaces. 
The virtual exhibition spaces will be open during the virtual poster sessions.
