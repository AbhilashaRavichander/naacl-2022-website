The NAACL tutorials will take place on **July 10, 2022** with tutorials delivered by expert researchers on topics of importance for our rapidly evolving research community.

The [call for tutorials](/calls/tutorials/) and the subsequent tutorial review and selection process was coordinated across four conferences. We thank the [tutorial chairs from ACL, COLING, and EMNLP](/calls/tutorials/#tutorial-chairs) for this joint experience, and also the additional external reviewers who participated in the review process. At NAACL, the option to seek reproducibility badging was introduced for accepted tutorials, thanks to the reproducibility chairs.

The [six tutorials](/program/tutorials/) selected for NAACL include one introductory tutorial and five cutting-edge tutorials. The introductory tutorial is dedicated to Human-Centered Evaluation of Explanations (T4). The cutting-edge tutorials are: (T1) Text Generation with Text-Editing Models, (T2) Self-supervised Representation Learning for Speech Processing, (T3) New Frontiers of Information Extraction, (T5) Multimodal Machine Learning, and (T6) Contrastive Data and Learning for Natural Language Processing. Prior to attending tutorials, you are welcome to review their recommended pre-readings.

All NAACL tutorials will be presented live in a **hybrid, synchronous** mode, with presenters teaching in-person or remotely. Additionally, the instructors for each tutorial are providing a website with tutorial materials: pre-recorded captioned video, slide deck, bibliography, and optionally other materials. 

The planned schedule for the tutorials includes live sessions which will support live Q&A, as well as two additional Zoom-based Q&A sessions for attendees unable to attend the live tutorial, for example due to their time zone.
