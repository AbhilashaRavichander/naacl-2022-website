## About Seattle

Seattle welcomes millions of visitors from around the world so many of you may already be familiar
with all that Seattle has to offer. Sightseeing, Arts &amp; Culture, Cultural Heritage, Outdoor hiking and
enjoying nature, cruising the bay or departing for longer cruises, LGBTQ activities, spectator and other
sports, etc. are just some of the things to keep you busy when not at the conference. Check out Visit
Seattle [Visit Seattle Washington | Travel &amp; Tourism | Official Site](https://visitseattle.org/) and read below 
for ideas and help in planning your Seattle adventures.

Realizing the COVID pandemic is of concern to everyone, here is the latest update about Seattle: As of
March 1, 2022, there is no longer a vaccine verification health order. And as of March 12, 2022,
Washington and King County will discontinue current mask mandates. Seattle was the first major
American city to fully vaccinate 70% of residents 12 and older. King County is now at a vaccination rate
of 88% and is safely welcoming back visitors. Many large corporations and businesses are beginning to
bring their workforce back to downtown, which will continue to enhance the visitor’s experience.

Both as the conference headquarters hotel and the conference venue, the [**Hyatt Regency Seattle**](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/washington/hyatt-regency-seattle/sears) will be

## Visa Information

The following questions will help you in determining whether and how to apply for a U.S. visa to attend the conference. 

**Can I travel to the U.S. without a visa?**

Please see [this page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html) to determine whether you are eligible to apply for an [Electronic System Travel Authorization (ESTA)](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/) instead, which might be cheaper and easier.  This is usually allowed if you hold a passport from a country that participates in the Visa Waiver Program, but there are some exceptions.  Be sure to apply for the ESTA at least 72 hours in advance.  [_Do not_](https://visaguide.world/tips/how-to-avoid-esta-fraud/) purchase your ESTA from any website other than the one linked above.

**What kind of visa do I need?**

To attend the conference, you should apply for a nonimmigrant B-1 visa.  (This also [permits](https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/documents/B-1%20permissible%20activities.pdf) you to engage in tourism during your trip.)

**How do I apply for a visa?**

Please apply well in advance.  Visa applications can take from 1&ndash;4 months to be approved and normally require an interview at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate.  For details, begin [here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html) and navigate to the website for the embassy or consulate nearest you for further visa instructions.

**How much will it cost?**

The non-refundable visa application fee is [approximately $160](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/fees/fees-visa-services.html#temp) in local currency.  Depending on your nationality, you may also have to pay a [visa issuance fee](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/Visa-Reciprocity-and-Civil-Documents-by-Country.html).

**Why should I request a visa invitation letter?**

A letter is not specifically required.  However, you are supposed to [bring documentation](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html) to your visa interview.  Bringing a letter from the conference organizers can help to establish the purpose of your trip: for example, we can document that you are coming to present a paper.  You can request such a letter [here](http://www.yesevents.com/NAACL-Visa).

In addition, if you have already paid for your registration, bringing your receipt can help to establish your ability to pay.  In some countries, it may also be wise to bring a letter from your own institution that authorizes you to attend the conference.

**What other documents may be needed in the visa interview?**

The answer to this question varies by the country where the interview is conducted, and perhaps also by your nationality.  Typically you will be asked to bring:
- your visa interview appointment letter
- [suitable](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/photos.html) photos or digital images
- your passport, valid for at least 6 months beyond the period of stay in the U.S.
- DS-160 application confirmation page
- application fee payment receipt

You may also bring other documentation that will help you answer the interviewer’s questions.  The interviewer is particularly interested to establish:
- The purpose of your trip.  See the previous question.  You may also be asked to bring your CV.
- Your intent to depart the United States after your trip.  You may wish to show your return ticket, and evidence of your work and family responsibilities outside the U.S.
- Your ability to pay all costs of the trip.  You may wish to show your bank statement, or evidence of travel grants or sponsorships, etc.
- Your U.S. stay address.  You may wish to bring your hotel booking information.

**Is it safe to go ahead and register for the conference before I have a visa?**

Yes. If your visa application is denied, you are entitled to [request](mailto:office@aclweb.org) a full refund of your conference registration fees.
